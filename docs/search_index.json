We are a research program with 38 research projects across 5 universities with 50 collaborators. Our aims are to provide data, tools, and practical solutions to improve the resilience of Canadian forests to various disturbances and sources of stress, thus contributing to the health of these ecosystems and the well-bring of the communities that depend on them. If you would like to further understand the aims and purpose of our project, please see our website at http://www.silva21.com "],["slack.html", "2 Slack", " 2 Slack Within the Silva21 Project and across every institution and partner involved with it, we use Slack for instant communication. Slack is an effective way to communicate with colleagues within various channels about any topic of interest. We use it for event planning and organization, networking with peers, and develop a community promoting the sharing of resources and knowledge. The Silva21 Slack portal ID is silva21.slack.com. The Silva21 Slack contains several channels, each serving different purposes. The most important channels are: #général - For general discussions on various topics #SITE_hub_site - For discussions and news related to an individual hub site #data - To discuss, share, plan, and locate datasets "],["data-portal-on-globus.html", "3 Data Portal on Globus 3.1 Access the Portal Using Globus Personal Connect 3.2 Globus Instructional Video", " 3 Data Portal on Globus The Silva21 Portal is through Compute Canada using the Globus interface. We use it to transfer, store, and share data among collaborators at every institutions. It uses highly secured and backed up facilities to host several TB of data. Examples of data being stored on the portal include LiDAR (and LiDAR-derived products), climate data, shapefiles, raster files, and any additional relevant data. Our online portal’s aims are: Create a fast, secure, and easy to use data portal Develop a large database for sharing data among every involved institution across Canada Implementation for long term archive Provide legacy for future research In order to access the data portal, you will need to contact either Michael Burnett mdmbur19@mail.ubc.ca or Amy Wotherspoon amy.wotherspoon@ubc.ca. When asking to be set up with an access account, please make sure to specify the email address you would like to have linked with your account. 3.1 Access the Portal Using Globus Personal Connect After your email has been granted reading and writing permissions onto the data portal, you should be redirected to the Globus “sign in” screen. Users can link multiple identities/email addresses to their Globus account. Therefore, they can select the institution from the list that they are affiliated with; it does not have to be directly related to the email address used to share the folder with them. If your institution/organization is not on the list, it is suggested to create a Globus ID, by selecting “Then use Globus ID to sign in” and then “Need a Globus ID? Sign Up”. You should use the email address you used to share the folder and select “non-profit research or educational purposes”. After you’ve created your account and logged in, you should be able to access the folder via the shared link. After connecting to the server, you may have to use the Globus Personal Connect if you want to upload more than one file at a time. Below are the documentation for Globus Personal Connect . This tool allows you to transfer files from the Silva21 Data Portal to a folder on your computer. The links below are detailed instructions for installing Globus Connect Personal on the different operating systems: Windows MacOS Linux After Globus Connect Personal is installed, you can search for your newly created endpoint on Globus. 1. Select File Manager (menu on the left) 2. Select the Collection search bar 3. Find your endpoint. Select the “Your Collections” tab.

Here is the list of items available at each location. "],["climate-data.html", "6 Climate Data 6.1 silvR21 - R Package", " 6 Climate Data Climate data has been collected and analysed for each one of the hub sites. The majority of the climate data has been accessed through ClimateNA. Multiple climate reports have been produced and are available on the portal and our website. If you would like more information, please consult with Amy Wotherspoon. 6.1 silvR21 - R Package To simplify methods of accessing and processing climate data from ClimateNA, I have made the SilvR21 package for R. It provides functions to prepare Digital Elevation Models (DEM) as TIFF files into CSV files, access historical and future projected climate data, and process the files in a similar fashion to how it has been used thus far within Silva21. Annual and seasonal means/sums can be computed from monthly data along with personalized GCM ensemble generators. To import it onto your computer, first you need to make sure that you have the devtools package installed. Then, please use devtools::install_github(\"Silva21-irss/silvR21\",build_vignettes = TRUE) to install it on your computer. The following is the R vignette for the silvR21 package. After downloading the package, you may search for it with browseVignettes('silvR21'). 6.1.1 silvR21 Vignette The silvR21 package is designed around the functions used to prepare, access, and process climate data within the Silva 21 Project. It uses the ClimateNA application, which “downscales PRISM 1971-2000 gridded monthly climate normal data (800 x 800 m) to scale-free point locations.” To further understand the variables and the application, please visit https://climatena.ca/. After installing the package, you may import the library. library(silvR21) Climate data is accessible from Digital Elevation Models (DEM). The two formats acceptable to the ClimateNA application are comma separated values (CSV) and the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). While the majority of this package is designed around the CSV format, ASCII raster files are also used. The table format for a CSV file must be specifically order and prepared to be accepted by the application. As a result, the demToCSV tool is first used to convert the DEM into a properly prepared CSV file, specifically formatted to be an input for any of the climate data acquisition functions. # Locate the current working directory getwd() #&gt; [1] &quot;E:/DEM/silvR21/vignettes&quot; # Select the DEM file used as input for climate data file &lt;- &quot;site_DEM.tif&quot; # No alternative output directory is specified, so the CSV file will be ouputted to the same location demToCSV(file) # Open the output CSV file dem &lt;- read.csv(&quot;site_DEM.csv&quot;) head(dem) #&gt; ID1 ID2 lat long el #&gt; 1 121 121 49.36102 122.5641 311.8277 #&gt; 2 122 122 49.36102 122.5607 443.1358 #&gt; 3 123 123 49.36102 122.5573 626.1150 #&gt; 4 124 124 49.36102 122.5538 727.7190 #&gt; 5 125 125 49.36102 122.5504 669.8089 #&gt; 6 126 126 49.36102 122.5469 506.9015 The resulting file is precisely formatted in the desired fashion for the ClimateNA application to receive it as input. The latitude and longitude are recorded as digital degrees in the Northern and Western hemispheres. It is not necessary to read the output file in your R environment; however, if projected climate data is desired, the CSV file must be relocated to the ClimateNA application’s directory. 6.1.1.1 Climate Data Acquisition 6.1.1.1.1 Historical Data Acquisition Three functions can be used to access historical data. They include histAnnualClimateNA, hist10YClimateNA, and hist30YClimateNA. Unlike future climate projections, historical data can be acquired from an input at any directory location on your computer. Only the working directory must be changed to the location of the application. All three functions have identical parameters with only dateR having different configuration. Using the DEM .csv file as input, a date range must be specified (dateR) as either a singular year ('1980'), a decade ('1991_2000'), or a 30 years period ('1961_1990'), depending on the historical data acquisition tool in use. For any date range, the first number must end with ‘1’ (such as 1971) and the last number must end with ‘0’ (such as 2000). Three options are available for the variables’ time frame (tFrame). These include annual (Y), seasonal (S), and monthly (M). The working directory must be changed to the same location as the ClimateNA application. Using the .exe file, an option is granted to relocate the output to any desired directory; however, if this parameter is not adjusted, the output will be located in the same directory as its input. # Change working directory to the application&#39;s location setwd(&#39;E:/ClimateNA_v30&#39;) # Access monthly climate data for 1972 histAnnualClimateNA(&#39;site_DEM.csv&#39;, &#39;1972&#39;, &#39;M&#39;, &#39;E:/ClimateNA_v30/ClimateNA_v7.30.exe&#39;) # Access seasonal climate data for the 1980s hist10YClimateNA(&#39;site_DEM.csv&#39;,&#39;1981_1990&#39;,&#39;S&#39;,&#39;E:/ClimateNA_v30/ClimateNA_v7.30.exe&#39;) # Access annual climate data for 1951 to 1980 and relocate the output hist30YClimateNA(&#39;site_DEM.csv&#39;,&#39;1951_1980&#39;,&#39;Y&#39;,&#39;E:/ClimateNA_v30/ClimateNA_v7.30.exe&#39;) # Access climate data with an ASCII file hist30YClimateNA(&#39;site_DEM.asc&#39;,&#39;1951_1980&#39;,&#39;Y&#39;,&#39;E:/ClimateNA_v30/ClimateNA_v7.30.exe&#39;) # Reproject ASCII output files setwd(paste0(getwd(),&#39;/site_DEM_1951_1980.csv/Normal_1951_1980&#39;)) asciiFiles &lt;- list.files() for(file in asciiFiles){ reprojectASCII(file) } When accessing climate data using an ASCII file rather than CSV, the output ASCII files will not be projected to any coordinate system, so a reprojection must be performed to visualize the data. If the desired output projection is EPSG 4326 and the NA values are -9999, no other parameter requires adjustment. For more information concerning the output variables, please consult the ClimateNA website. 6.1.1.1.2 Future Climate Projection Data Acquisition For acquisition of future climate projections, the input files must be located within the same directory as the ClimateNA application. Only one type of date range is available to access using R. 30 years normals along with annual projections are also available, but only when opening the application, not currently with R. Much like it is done with the historical data acquisition functions, the selection of climactic variable time frames (tFrame) and locating the .exe file is done in a similar manner. The projClimateNA20Y tool has additional parameters where the General Circulation Models (GCM) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) can be selected, along with four different Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios over five 20-years time frames. If left alone, these parameters are set to include the options used in the climate reports for Silva21. To further visualize and compare the projections and scenarios, please visit https://bcgov-env.shinyapps.io/cmip6-BC/. scen is representative of the selectable GCM projections ssp is the SSP scenario parameter years is the time frame parameter # Change working directory to the application&#39;s location setwd(&#39;E:/ClimateNA_v30&#39;) # Use the same GCMs, SSPs, and time frames as used within the climate reports for Silva21 projClimateNA20Y(&#39;site_DEM.csv&#39;,&#39;M&#39;,&#39;E:/ClimateNA_v30/ClimateNA_v7.30.exe&#39;) # Access only the 8GCM ensemble for the two &quot;worst-case&quot; SSP scenarios in the last 40 years of the 21st Century projClimateNA20Y(&#39;site_DEM.csv&#39;,&#39;M&#39;,&#39;E:/ClimateNA_v30/ClimateNA_v7.30.exe&#39;, scen = &#39;8GCM&#39;, ssp = c(&#39;S3&#39;,&#39;S5&#39;), years = c(&#39;Y4&#39;,&#39;Y5&#39;)) The outputs from this function will be located within the folder in the application’s directory named after the input CSV file. Each output file is appropriately named after the GCM, SSP, and time frame it represents. The use of gcmSepCols divides the elements of the file name into three manageable columns projFile &lt;- &quot;ACCESS-ESM1-5_ssp370_2061-2080.csv&quot; gcmSepCols(projFile) #&gt; files Time_Frame SSP Climate_Model #&gt; 1 ACCESS-ESM1-5_ssp370_2061-2080.csv 2061-2080 ssp370 ACCESS-ESM1-5 6.1.1.2 Climate Data Processing Tools 6.1.1.2.1 Calculating Annual and Seasonal Summaries from Monthly Data Generally, monthly data is acquired and reprocessed to access seasonal and annual data. To simplify the processing methods, the AnnualSeasonalMeans function is available. It produces mean seasonal and annual values from monthly temperature, solar radiation, and relative humidity data values and sums for all other variables. It is then re-outputted into the same CSV files. projFile &lt;- &quot;ACCESS-ESM1-5_ssp370_2061-2080.csv&quot; data &lt;- read.csv(projFile) # Compute annual and seasonal mean and sum values for every variable AnnualSeasonalMeans(data, var = c(&#39;Tmax&#39;,&#39;Tmin&#39;,&#39;Tave&#39;,&#39;PPT&#39;,&#39;Rad&#39;,&#39;DD_5&#39;,&#39;DD5&#39;,&#39;DD_18&#39;,&#39;DD18&#39;,&#39;NFFD&#39;,&#39;PAS&#39;,&#39;Eref&#39;,&#39;CMD&#39;,&#39;RH&#39;,&#39;CMI&#39;)) #

The SSP and time frame selection must be carefully adjusted to represent the real data, otherwise it is prone to fail with an error. setwd(paste0(getwd(),&#39;/site_DEM&#39;)) files &lt;- list.files(pattern=&#39;*csv&#39;) ensembleGenerator(files,tFrame=c(&#39;M&#39;,&#39;S&#39;,&#39;Y&#39;),years = c(&#39;Y4&#39;,&#39;Y5&#39;), concatenate = TRUE) The results will be included in a new GCMensemble directory. With concatenation, two additional files are outputted including a megafile which includes all of the data in one CSV file and an Area-Mean summary file. "]]
